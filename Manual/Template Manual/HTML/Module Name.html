          <h2>On the Subject of Kuro</h2>
          <p class="flavour-text">Look at this Hawker guy</p>

          <p>You are Kuro, a Brit who spends all his time in the KTANE server doing different things. You must figure out what you need to get done for the day.</p>

          <p>Figure out what you are doing based on the time the bomb was started:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>If it is between 9:00 am and 12:59 pm, you are <b>maintaining the repo</b>.</li>
            <li>If it is between 1:00 pm and 3:59 pm, you are <b>creating a module</b>.</li>
            <li>If it is between 4:00 pm and 6:59 pm, you are <b>eating</b>.</li>
            <li>If it is between 7:00 pm and 9:59 pm, you are <b>playing KTANE</b>.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you are <b>getting ready for bed</b>.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Maintaining the Repo</h3>
          If you are Maintaining the repo, click on the <b>#repo-request</b> channel to see what new requests have been posted.

          <p>You will see 3 requests by three different users. For each request, find your starting value by finding how much you tolerate the person making the request.</p>

          <p>If you get ☠️, that means you hate the person so much, you will not further consider their request.</p>

          <p>After getting your starting value, modify it based on what the task is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Making interactives: -2</li>
            <li>Uploading manuals: -1</li>
            <li>Fixing grammar mistakes: +0</li>
            <li>Dark Mode Support: +1</li>
            <li>Svgifying things: +2</li>
            <li>LFA Support: +3</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If the module that is named in the request is on the bomb, double the value. Select the person who has the highest value. If there is a tie, click on the first tied one that appears from
            top to bottom.

          <h3>Creating Mods</h3>
          <p>
            If there is a module on the bomb that Kuro is the developer of, you must first join <b>Chill Zone Alfa</b>. Solving a module Kuro made before joining the channel will cause a strike and
            add Kuro to the channel automatically. You must solve all said modules, and then leave the call. Attempting to leave the call before all said modules are solved will result in a strike.
          </p>

          <p>
            Otherwise, Kuro must come up with an idea for a module. Click on the <b>#mod-ideas</b> channel. Disregard any modules that have anything to do with needies. If a module idea's topic is
            related to something Kuro loves, select that option. However, if the module idea was presented by Curlbot, pressing that option will result in a strike. If there are no ideas that Kuro
            loves, pick any other option, unless it's from Curl. If there are no non-needy modules that are not from Curl, you may pick a needy. Kuro would rather do a needy than interact with Curl.
          </p>
          <h3>Eating</h3>

          <p>Figure out what mood Kuro is in based on his profile picture:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If he is happy, he will want to be with his friends. Go to vc with the most amount of people in it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if he is neutral, then he will want to be with some people, but not a lot. Pick the channel that will have the second most amount of people in it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, pick the voice channel that has the least amount of people.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><b>HOWEVER,</b> if the selected voice channel has Curlbot in it, select the next voice channel going down, wrapping around if necessary.</p>

          <p>Once you figured out where you want to be, you will hear a voice line from Kuro about what he wants to eat. Pick that option to solve the module.</p>

          <h3>Playing KTANE</h3>
          <p>Join <b>Modded Alfa</b> and look into <b>#voice-text-modded</b> in that order. You will see two people, one would like to expert and the other person would like to defuse.</p>

          <p>
            If Kuro is happy or neutral, he would like to defuse. Otherwise, he would like to expert. If CurlBot is one of the people who wants to play, leave the call. Otherwise, figure out how much
            you tolerate each person. If the person you tolerate more wants to do the same role as you, pick the opposite role. Otherwise, pick your desired role. If there is a tie, pick your desired
            role.
          </p>

          <h3>Getting ready for bed</h3>
          <p>Join any voice channel (as long as Curl is not in it), and leave any time to solve the module.</p>
