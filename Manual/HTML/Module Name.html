        <h2>On the Subject of Kuro</h2>
        <p class="flavour-text">Look at this Hawker guy</p>

        <p>You are Kuro, a Brit who spends all his time in the KTANE server doing different things. You must figure out
          what you need to get done for the day.</p>

        <p>Figure out what you are doing based on the rules below:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Take the time the bomb started</li>
          <li>Take the highest out of batteries, indicators and ports</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If the number of batteries is the highest, add 1 hour for each batteries</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if the number of indicators is the highest, add 30 minutes for each indicators</li>
            <li>Otherwise, add 15 minutes for each port. This includes ties</li>
          </ul>
          <li>For each vowel in the serial number, subtract 1 hour</li>
          <li>For each consonant in the serial number, subtract 30 minutes</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If your final time is between:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>09:00 and 12:59, you are <b>maintaining the repo</b>.</li>
          <li>13:00 and 15:59, you are <b>creating a module</b>.</li>
          <li>16:00 and 18:59, you are <b>eating</b>.</li>
          <li>19:00 and 21:59, you are <b>playing KTANE</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Otherwise, you are <b>getting ready for bed</b></p>

        <h3>Maintaining the Repo</h3>
        If you are maintaining the repo, click on the <b>#repo-request</b> channel to see what new requests have been
        posted.

        <p>You will see 3 requests by three different users. For each request, find your starting value by figuring how
          much you tolerate the person making the request by using the table found at the bottom of this manual.</p>

        <p>If you get ☠️, that means you hate the person so much, you will not consider their request at all.</p>





      </div>
      <div class="page-footer relative-footer">1</div>

    <div class="page page-bg-02">
      <div class="page-header">
        <span class="page-header-doc-title">Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes Mod</span>
        <span class="page-header-section-title">Kuro</span>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">
        <p>After getting your starting value, modify it based on what the task is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Making interactives: -2</li>
          <li>Uploading manuals: -1</li>
          <li>Fixing grammar mistakes: +0</li>
          <li>Dark Mode Support: +1</li>
          <li>LFA Support: +2</li>
          <li>Svgifying things: +3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the module that is named in the request is on the bomb, double the value. Claim the request that has the
          highest value. If there is a tie, claim the first tied request that appears from
          top to bottom.
        </p>

        <p>To claim a request, click on the user's profile picture.</p>
        <h3>Creating Mods</h3>
        <p>
          If there is a solvable module on the bomb that Kuro is the developer of, you must first join <b>Chill Zone Alfa</b>.
          Solving a module Kuro made before joining the channel will cause a strike and
          add Kuro to the channel automatically. You must solve all said modules, and then leave the call. Attempting to
          leave the call before all said modules are solved will result in a strike.
        </p>

        <p><i>Note: Modules that are made by Kuro are defined where he is credited as the developer. If the data fails to load, a triangle will appear in the top right of the module. This means a hard coded list of Kuro modules will be used instead of what is on the repo. This list includes: Technical Keypad, Procedural Maze, Blank Slate, Orientation Hypercube, Shy Guy Says, Samuel Says, and Coloured Cubes.</i></p>

        <p>
          Otherwise, Kuro must come up with an idea for a module. Click on the <b>#mod-ideas</b> channel. Disregard any
          modules that have anything to do with needies. If a module idea's topic is
          related to something Kuro loves, select that option. However, if the module idea was presented by Curlbot,
          pressing that option will result in a strike. If there are no ideas that Kuro
          loves, pick any other option, unless it's from Curl. If there are no non-needy modules that are not from Curl,
          you may pick a needy. Kuro would rather do a needy than interact with Curl.
        </p>

        <h3>Eating</h3>

        <p>You must figure out which one of the <b>Chill Zone</b> voice channels you must join and what to eat.</p>
        <p>Figure out what mood Kuro is in based on his profile picture:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If he is happy, he will want to be with his friends. Go to voice channel with the most amount of people in it.</li>
          <li>Otherwise, if he is neutral, then he will want to be with some people, but not a lot. Pick the channel
            that will have the second most amount of people in it.</li>
          <li>Otherwise, if he is angry, pick the voice channel that has the least amount of people.</li>
          <li>Otherwise, if he is devious, he wants to torment CurlBot. Join the voice channel he is in.</li>
          <li>Otherwise, he is curious. Join any voice channel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>HOWEVER,</b> if the selected voice channel has Curlbot in it, select the next voice channel going down,
          wrapping around if necessary. This rule does not apply if he is devious or curious.</p>
        <p>Once you figured out where you want to be, you will hear a voice line from Kuro about what he wants to eat.
          Pick that option to solve the module.</p>
        <h3>Playing KTANE</h3>
        <p>Join <b>Modded Alfa</b> and look at <b>#voice-text-modded</b> in that order. You will see two people, one
          would like to expert and the other person would like to defuse.</p>
        <p>
          If Kuro is happy or neutral, he would like to defuse. Otherwise, he would like to expert. If CurlBot is one of
          the people who wants to play, leave the call. Otherwise, figure out how much
          you tolerate each person. If the person you tolerate more prefers do the same role as you, pick the opposite
          role. Otherwise, pick your desired role. If there is a tie, pick your desired
          role.
        </p>
        <h3>Getting ready for bed</h3>
        <p>Join any chill zone voice channel (as long as Curl is not in it), and leave any time to solve the module.</p>
